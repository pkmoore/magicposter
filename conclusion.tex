\section{Conclusion}
\label{SEC:conclusion}

In this paper we present a novel approach to teaching
an introductory information security
class by using card magic to illustrate key concepts.
By first presenting a card trick that shows how an attack works,
we are able to find common ground with students,
even those with very little knowledge of the field.
After testing this lesson plan in a
real-world teaching environment,
we found that it is highly effective at both
fostering engagement and improving students' mastery of the covered
material.
We encourage our fellow educators to use the tricks we have developed and to
develop new ones as a way to make complex and intimidating
material more approachable for novice students.
Doing so could potentially improve not only individual performance, but also
retention of students.
