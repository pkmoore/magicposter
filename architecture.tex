\section{Architecture}
\label{SEC:architecture}

[This is how the system actually works.  Go in depth with the design, but 
don't describe implementation details (most of the time).  That usually
goes in a separate impl section.  So, explain the commonalities if someone 
implement it on a different OS w/ a different language, using different
file formats, etc.]

[Diagrams are useful here.  This is usually 2-3 pages and can also have 
multiple sections]
